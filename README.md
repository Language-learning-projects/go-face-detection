# Go face detection

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "Go face detection".

It's purpose is to detect and recognize faces in images using different algorithms.

## Idea

A web service that uses computer vision algorithms to detect and recognize faces in images. The service should use a slice data structure to store the pixels and a Haar cascade algorithm to detect the faces. The service should also use a map data structure to store the labels and a K-nearest neighbors algorithm to recognize the faces.

## Learning

- Go
- Map
- Slice
- Haar cascade algorithm
- K-nearest neighbors algorithm

## Requirements

- A user must be able to get the amount of faces in a picture by passing the algorithm an image.
- A user must be able to get an altered version of the image with a square around the faces.
- A user must be able to find out who is in the image by using known image data.
